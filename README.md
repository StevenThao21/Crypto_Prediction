Crypto Prediction with LSTM 

A time series forecasting project using LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) neural networks to predict cryptocurrency prices. 

Project overview 
This project use deep learning to forecast cryptocurrency prices based on historical data from yahoo finance database. 
- Data preprocessing with pandas ans scikit-learn
- LSTM model implemented in TensorFlow and Keras
- Viuualization using matplolib
- Evaluation with RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)

How to run: 
I would say the easiest option to run this is using Google Colab.
